# GameSharp
GameSharp is a Scratch API that contains some remastered original Scratch features.

# WHY THIS AWFUL API WAS MADE
I really wanted to use HaxeFlixel, but I couldn't because I was running out of space. I decided to make a Scratch API, similar to HaxeFlixel.

# HOW TO INSTALL
To create the GameSharproject, you gonna need "Scratch Desktop" or the "Scratch Website".
After that, download the sb3 file (gamesharp-v0.1.0.sb3), then select File > Open File from your Computer then select gamesharp-v0.1.0.sb3. When you open it, KEEP GameSharp_Engine AND GameSprite. To create new sprites with the GameSharp engine, duplicate GameSprite.
